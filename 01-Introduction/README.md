# Introduction to Generative AI

## Overview

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that create new and original content based on patterns they learn from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on tasks like classification or prediction, generative AI creates things such as text, images, music, and even videos.

### Examples:
- **Text Generation**: AI that can write articles, stories, or even poetry.
- **Image Creation**: AI that can generate new images based on text descriptions.
- **Music Composition**: AI that can compose original pieces of music.

This type of AI is used in many industries, including entertainment, marketing, design, and software development, to automate content creation and boost creativity.

## Primary Uses of Generative AI

Generative AI can be applied in several fields. Here are some popular uses:

- **Text Generation**: Writing essays, stories, or chatbot responses (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4).
- **Image Generation**: Creating realistic or artistic images from descriptions (e.g., DALL-E).
- **Music Creation**: Composing original music (e.g., MuseNet).
- **Code Generation**: Writing programming code based on instructions (e.g., GitHub Copilot).
- **Video Generation**: Creating synthetic videos or enhancing real ones (e.g., Deepfakes).

## Tech Stacks and Tools Used in Generative AI

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the tools and skills needed to get started with Generative AI:
